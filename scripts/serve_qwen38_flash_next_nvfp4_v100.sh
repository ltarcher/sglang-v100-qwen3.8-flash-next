  # FILE TIER WRITE POLICY = write_back (2026-08-31, after reboot): the

  # 3108: SMART clean, 2.2-3.2 GB/s quiescent, BMC no degraded/rebuilding)
  # but collapse to 20-50 MB/s while the file tier's write_through dirties
  # page cache (45k-token prefill: concurrent cold dd 30 MB/s; 678 MB/s 5s
  # after; writeback storm drains for minutes -- DRAM-less consumer SSDs
  # eat the SLC cache). That is what made the disk READBACK path measure
  # 344 tok/s (3 tok/s at 55k tokens) -- it was reading from a
  # write-saturated array. write_back (hi_mamba_radix_cache.py): no
  # device->host->disk writes on hits; disk writes ONLY on tier eviction
  # (memory pressure) and shutdown flush. Steady state: zero disk writes;
  # the 128Gi host tier holds hot sessions (a pinned 230k session ~35GB
  # fits one replica's 64Gi pool). Disk tier keeps its designed job:
  # cross-replica sharing + restart durability. Do NOT switch back to
  # write_through on this box without solving the writeback QoS collapse.
  # (write_through_selective is NOT an alternative: agentic sessions
  # re-hit the same prefix every turn, so the hit_count>=2 threshold fires
  # within a turn -> effectively full write volume.)
